# Client Side Is Still Bad

## Question 
  > I forgot my password again, but this time there doesn't seem to be a reset, can you help me? http://2018shell.picoctf.com:8420
## Hint
  > Client Side really is a bad way to do it.
## Solution
 Inspect the source code of the web page. In the Element tab, body, script function "verify()", the password is broken up but clearly visible in reverse order. If you're feeling extra, piecing it together correctly and using it as the log in value will result in a `"You got the flag!" alert`
