## Hint
  > How do you inspect a website's code on a browser?
  
  > Check all the website code.
## Solution
 Inspect the code in any web browser capable of it.The code is spilt into three parts:
 
 javascript Body - `<!-- I learned HTML! Here's part 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspe --> == $0`
 Sources -> mycss.css - `/* I learned CSS! Here's part 2/3 of the flag: ct0r_g4dget_b4887011} */`
 Sources -> myjs.js - `/* I learned JavaScript! Here's part 3/3 of the flag:  */`
 
 It is not clear what part 3/3 is for since 2/3 includes closing brackets. The combination of 1/3 and 2/3 are enough for a correct solution.
 
### Flag
`picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspect0r_g4dget_b4887011}`
